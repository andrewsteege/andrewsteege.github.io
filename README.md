This Html file is a portfolio about me. In it I git a bit of a biography about myself, and list a few of my favorite projects. I also included various ways that a veiwer may contact me.
Also if a future employer were to look at my portfolio I have included links to the listed projects, and shown my resume to look through, and a link on "Resume" that opens directly to my resume.
